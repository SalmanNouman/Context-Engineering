# What is Vibe Coding?

I'm sure you've heard of the term "vibe coding" before. It's a cool term that describes the process of coding without any specific plan or strategy, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. Because LLMs are getting too good, software engineers or even students can simply sit down and automate the software creation prcess without even thinking much about it.

# What's the problem?

The reliance on inituition and repitition is huge in vibe coding. The fact that you iterate on different ideas and problems without actually thinking about them will eventually lead to a lack of innovation and creativity. The term itself is based on hope that the AI can somehow read your mind and fill in the massive gaps in your request. This approach is inefficient, unreliable, and often dangerous.

# New Paradigm (Context Engineering)

Before we even start coding, we need to have a clear understanding of what we're trying to achieve, the problem we're trying to solve, the solution we're trying to implement, and the context we're trying to work in. Context Engineering solves this problem by providing a clear and concise way to communicate our requirements to the AI.
