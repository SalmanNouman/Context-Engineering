# Validation Checklist

## Feature: Task Management System

Use this checklist to validate that the implemented task management system meets all requirements and quality standards.

## Functional Requirements Validation

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Task Creation: Users can create new tasks with all required fields
- [ ] Task Editing: Users can modify existing tasks
- [ ] Task Deletion: Users can remove tasks they no longer need
- [ ] Task Status: Users can mark tasks as "Not Started", "In Progress", or "Complete"
- [ ] Task Filtering: Users can filter tasks by status, category, priority, and due date
- [ ] Task Sorting: Users can sort tasks by different criteria
- [ ] Statistics: System accurately calculates and displays task statistics

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty task list: UI handles empty state gracefully with helpful message
- [ ] Past due dates: System allows but visually indicates overdue tasks
- [ ] Very long task titles/descriptions: Text truncates appropriately
- [ ] Many tasks (100+): Performance remains acceptable
- [ ] Duplicate task titles: System allows but warns user

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid form inputs: Appropriate validation errors shown
- [ ] Storage quota exceeded: User notified with helpful message
- [ ] Data corruption: System attempts recovery or provides reset option
- [ ] Network disconnection: Changes saved locally and synced when reconnected

## Code Quality Validation

### Architecture and Design
- [ ] Follows React component architecture
- [ ] Properly separates concerns (presentation vs. logic)
- [ ] Uses context API appropriately for global state
- [ ] Implements custom hooks for reusable logic
- [ ] Maintains loose coupling between components

### Code Style
- [ ] Follows naming conventions in PROJECT_RULES.md
- [ ] Uses TypeScript types/interfaces consistently
- [ ] No any types or type assertions
- [ ] No magic numbers or hardcoded values
- [ ] Consistent error handling approach

### Performance
- [ ] Renders large lists efficiently
- [ ] Minimizes unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Optimizes expensive calculations
- [ ] Efficient localStorage usage
- [ ] Acceptable response times for all operations

### Security
- [ ] Input validation implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in localStorage
- [ ] Protected against XSS via proper React practices
- [ ] No unsafe eval() or dangerouslySetInnerHTML

## Testing Validation

### Unit Tests
- [ ] All utility functions have unit tests
- [ ] Custom hooks tested with renderHook
- [ ] Context providers and reducers tested
- [ ] Component props and events tested
- [ ] Tests cover happy paths and error cases

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Task creation flow tested
- [ ] Task editing and deletion tested
- [ ] Filtering and sorting functionality tested
- [ ] Data persistence between sessions tested

### End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Complete user flows tested
- [ ] Responsive behavior tested across device sizes
- [ ] Keyboard navigation tested

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Meets minimum 80% coverage requirement
- [ ] All critical paths tested

## Documentation Validation

### Code Documentation
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces documented
- [ ] Complex functions explained with comments
- [ ] Component props documented
- [ ] Custom hooks documented with examples

### User Documentation
- [ ] Feature usage documented
- [ ] UI elements explained
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts listed
- [ ] Error messages are helpful

### Technical Documentation
- [ ] Architecture decisions documented
- [ ] Data flow explained
- [ ] State management approach documented
- [ ] Performance considerations noted

## Accessibility Validation

- [ ] Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Proper heading structure
- [ ] Appropriate ARIA attributes
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all features
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet standards
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility tested

## Cross-Browser/Platform Validation

- [ ] Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- [ ] Functions on desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes
- [ ] Touch interactions work properly on mobile
- [ ] Consistent appearance across platforms

## User Acceptance Validation

- [ ] All user stories from feature request satisfied
- [ ] Task creation takes less than 30 seconds
- [ ] Filtering and sorting is intuitive
- [ ] Statistics provide useful insights
- [ ] UI is visually appealing and consistent

## Final Validation

- [ ] All acceptance criteria from feature request met
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] LocalStorage data structure is as designed
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with large datasets
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] All tests pass

## Notes and Observations

During validation, pay special attention to:
1. Performance with large numbers of tasks
2. Mobile usability, especially form inputs
3. Accessibility of drag-and-drop features
4. Edge cases around recurring tasks

**Note to AI Assistant:** Use this checklist to validate your implementation. Mark items as complete only when you have verified them. If any items fail validation, address the issues before considering the feature complete.
