# Feature Request

## Feature Name: Task Management System

## Overview
Implement a task management system that allows users to create, update, delete, and track tasks. The system should support task categorization, due dates, priority levels, and status tracking.

## User Stories
- As a student, I want to create new tasks so that I can track my assignments and deadlines
- As a student, I want to categorize tasks by subject/course so that I can organize my workload
- As a student, I want to set priority levels so that I can focus on the most important tasks first
- As a student, I want to mark tasks as complete so that I can track my progress
- As a student, I want to filter tasks by status, category, or due date so that I can focus on relevant tasks

## Detailed Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Create new tasks with title, description, due date, category, and priority
- Edit existing tasks to update any field
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed
- Mark tasks as "Not Started", "In Progress", or "Complete"
- Filter and sort tasks by various criteria
- Display task statistics (e.g., completion rate, upcoming deadlines)
- Support for recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Task operations must complete in under 200ms
- Security: Tasks should only be visible to their creator
- Usability: Interface should be intuitive and require minimal training
- Compatibility: Must work on all major browsers and be responsive for mobile devices
- Accessibility: Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, minimalist design with focus on readability
- Color-coding for priority levels (High: Red, Medium: Yellow, Low: Green)
- Drag-and-drop interface for changing task status
- Calendar view for visualizing due dates
- List view for detailed task information
- Dark mode support

## Technical Considerations
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- State Management: React Context API with hooks
- Data Persistence: LocalStorage for offline functionality
- Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Potential challenge: Efficient filtering and sorting of large task lists

## Examples and References
- See `examples/sample-code/TaskItem.tsx` for component structure
- See `examples/sample-code/useLocalStorage.ts` for data persistence pattern
- Reference: Material Design guidelines for UI components
- Pattern to follow: Container/Presentational component pattern

## Edge Cases and Error Handling
- What happens if a user tries to create a task with a past due date? Allow but show warning
- How should the system handle network disconnections? Save changes locally and sync when reconnected
- What are the validation requirements for task titles? Non-empty, max 100 characters

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can create, edit, and delete tasks
- [ ] Tasks can be categorized and prioritized
- [ ] Tasks can be filtered and sorted by multiple criteria
- [ ] Task statistics are accurately calculated and displayed
- [ ] Interface is responsive and works on mobile devices
- [ ] All accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] Data persists between sessions

## Out of Scope
- Team collaboration features are out of scope
- File attachments to tasks are out of scope
- Integration with external calendars is out of scope

## Dependencies
- Depends on authentication system for user identification
- Requires access to browser localStorage

## Additional Context
- This feature is primarily targeted at students managing coursework
- User research shows that students prefer simple interfaces with powerful filtering
- Most users will access the system on mobile devices between classes
