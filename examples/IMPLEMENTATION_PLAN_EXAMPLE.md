# Implementation Plan

## Feature: Task Management System

## Overview
This implementation plan outlines the step-by-step approach to build a task management system for students. We'll follow a component-based architecture using React with TypeScript, focusing on clean code, performance, and user experience.

## Prerequisites
- React and TypeScript development environment set up
- Understanding of React hooks and context API
- Knowledge of localStorage for data persistence

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Project Structure and Data Models
**Description:** Create the foundational structure for the application and define the core data models.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create React application with TypeScript template
- [ ] Set up folder structure (components, hooks, contexts, types, utils)
- [ ] Define Task interface with properties (id, title, description, dueDate, category, priority, status)
- [ ] Create type definitions for task categories, priorities, and statuses
- [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use UUID for generating unique task IDs
- Ensure type safety across the application
- Consider future extensibility in the data model design

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Project structure follows best practices
- [ ] Type definitions are comprehensive and properly exported
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configurations are working correctly

### Step 2: Implement Data Persistence with Context API and localStorage
**Description:** Create a data layer that manages tasks and persists them to localStorage.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement useLocalStorage custom hook
- [ ] Create TaskContext with provider for global state management
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for tasks (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Add functions for filtering and sorting tasks
- [ ] Implement task statistics calculations

**Technical Considerations:**
- Handle localStorage limitations (5MB per domain)
- Implement error handling for storage failures
- Optimize state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Data persists between page refreshes
- [ ] CRUD operations work correctly
- [ ] Filtering and sorting functions return expected results
- [ ] Statistics calculations are accurate

### Step 3: Build Core UI Components
**Description:** Develop the essential UI components for task management.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create TaskForm component for adding/editing tasks
- [ ] Implement TaskItem component for displaying individual tasks
- [ ] Build TaskList component to display and manage multiple tasks
- [ ] Create FilterBar component for filtering and sorting options
- [ ] Implement StatisticsPanel component for task statistics

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop validation
- Ensure components are reusable and maintainable
- Follow accessibility best practices

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Components render correctly with different props
- [ ] Form validation works as expected
- [ ] Components are responsive on different screen sizes
- [ ] Components meet accessibility standards

### Step 4: Implement Advanced Features
**Description:** Add more sophisticated features to enhance the user experience.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop for changing task status
- [ ] Create calendar view for visualizing due dates
- [ ] Add support for recurring tasks
- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop functionality
- Optimize calendar view for performance with many tasks
- Implement theme switching with CSS variables

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works smoothly
- [ ] Calendar view correctly displays tasks by due date
- [ ] Recurring tasks are created and managed properly
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works across all components
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts function as expected

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test all utility functions
- [ ] Test custom hooks (useLocalStorage, etc.)
- [ ] Test context providers and reducers
- [ ] Test individual component rendering and behavior

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test task creation flow
- [ ] Test task editing and deletion
- [ ] Test filtering and sorting functionality
- [ ] Test data persistence between sessions

### End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Test complete user flows (create, edit, complete, delete tasks)
- [ ] Test responsive behavior across device sizes
- [ ] Test accessibility with screen readers

## Rollout Plan
- Phase 1: Core functionality (CRUD operations, basic UI)
- Phase 2: Advanced filtering and sorting
- Phase 3: Calendar view and statistics
- Phase 4: Recurring tasks and keyboard shortcuts

## Rollback Plan
- Store version information with saved data
- Implement data migration strategies for backward compatibility
- Keep backup of user data before major updates

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Create README with setup instructions
- [ ] Document component API and props
- [ ] Create user guide with screenshots
- [ ] Document keyboard shortcuts and advanced features

## Success Metrics
- Metric 1: Task creation time under 30 seconds
- Metric 2: Task completion rate tracking accuracy
- Metric 3: User satisfaction with filtering capabilities

## Timeline Estimate
- Step 1: 1 day
- Step 2: 2 days
- Step 3: 3 days
- Step 4: 2 days
- Total: 8 days of development time

## Resources Required
- React and TypeScript documentation
- Material Design guidelines
- WCAG accessibility guidelines

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk 1: Performance issues with large numbers of tasks
  - Mitigation: Implement pagination and virtual scrolling
- Risk 2: Data loss due to localStorage limitations
  - Mitigation: Implement data export/import functionality
- Risk 3: Complex UI becoming confusing for users
  - Mitigation: Conduct usability testing and simplify where needed
